Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

Package: cidrcalc
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libcidr0
Description: Takes in a CIDR block, and gives you a quick set of stats about it.
 cidrcalc is a program similar to ipcalc in that it takes in a CIDR block, and
 gives you a quick set of stats about it; number of hosts in the given subnet,
 network and broadcast addresses, netmask in prefix and netmask form,
 Cisco-style wildcard mask, and optionally binary expansion and super/subnet
 info. Unlike ipcalc, though, it supports IPv6. Useful thing to have around
 when you're planning your subnetting scheme.
